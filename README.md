# Javascript-Rock-Paper-Scissors

freeCodeCamp Practice Project.

JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.


In the previous projects you learned how to work with basic DOM manipulation. Now it is time to review what you have learned by building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

In this mini project, you will review conditionals, functions, getElementById, and more. This project will give you an opportunity to solve small problems and get a better understanding of the basics.
